    # Specification
    
    The exact specification is very much up for discussion!
    
    For now, you can simply [convert](nbconvert.jupyter) an existing notebook and
    have a look at the resulting file in a text editor.
    And of course you can have a look at the source code.
    
    If you have ideas for improving the (currently informal) specification or the
    example implementation, please open an issue or pull request at
    https://github.com/mgeier/jupyter-format/.
