    # Installation
    
    Since `jupyter_format` is in an experimental state,
    it is deliberately *not* available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org).
    
    But if you want to play around with it,
    you can get it from [Github](https://github.com/mgeier/jupyter-format)
    and make an "editable" installation with
    
        git clone https://github.com/mgeier/jupyter-format.git
        cd jupyter-format
        python3 -m pip install -e .
    
    Depending on your Python installation,
    you may have to use `python` instead of `python3`.
    
    If you don't need a local Git checkout,
    you can also directly install it with
    
        python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/mgeier/jupyter-format.git@master

    ## JupyterLab and Classic Notebook Integration
    
    If you want to be able to load and save Jupyter notebooks in the new format,
    you can specify a custom "contents manager" in your configuration.
    
    You can find your configuration directory with
    
        python3 -m jupyter --config-dir
    
    If you don't yet have a configuration file there,
    you can generate it with JupyterLab:
    
        python3 -m jupyterlab --generate-config
    
    If you still use the Classic Notebook, generate the file with
    
        python3 -m notebook --generate-config
    
    To enable the custom "contents manager",
    simply open the file `jupyter_notebook_config.py`and add this line:
    
    ```python
    c.NotebookApp.contents_manager_class = 'jupyter_format.contents_manager.FileContentsManager'
    ```
    
    <div class="alert alert-info">
    
    At the time of writing this,
    JupyterLab is not yet able to open `*.jupyter` files by double-clicking.
    You have to right-click and use "Open With" $\to$ "Notebook".

    ## Usage on Binder
    
    If you want to use the new format on https://mybinder.org (which is great!),
    just create a configuration file in your repository using the path
    
        .jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py
    
    ... and put the above-mentioned line in it.
